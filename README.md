# crypto_investments---This Jupyter notebook clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. It plots the results to visually show the performance.The data is provided in a CSV file in the Resources folder The chart below shows the construction of the data<br><img src="images/scrn1.jpg"><br>The data is calculated using the elbow algorithm in order to determine the optimal value for k<br><img src="images/scrn2.jpg"><br>The data is then calculated using the Kmeans algorithm in order to cluster the cryptocurrencies<img src="images/scrn3.jpg"><br><br>The data is then charted with the PCA algorithm and analyzed side by side with the original data in order to determine the value of the different methods.---## TechnologiesThis notebook requires:![Jupyter Logo](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/_static/jupyter.svg)<br>This notebook requires Jupyter lab<br>Installation:```pip install jupyterlab````This applications uses pandas<br>![pandas Logo](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/_static/pandas.svg)```pip install pandas```This application uses Pathlib<br>```pip install pathlib```![scikit learn Logo](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/scikit-learn-logo-small.png)<br>This application uses scikit learn```pip install scikit-learn```## ContributorsBrought to you by Rachel Bates---## LicenseCreative Commons
